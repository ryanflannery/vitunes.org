<h3 class="uk-h3">General Usage Questions</h3>

<dl class="faq">

   <dt>How do I change the meta-information of a file within vitunes?</dt>
   <dd>
      Use the <a href="man/vitunes-tag.html">tag</a> e-command (or another
      application) followed by an <a href="man/vitunes-update.html">update</a>.
      <br /><br />
      The next time you launch vitunes you will see the changes (or
      you can issue a <code>:reload db</code> command within vitunes).
   </dd>

   <dt>I moved a bunch of my music around.  How do I update vitunes?</dt>
   <dd>
      Use the <a href="man/vitunes-update.html">update</a> e-command to remove
      any moved files and then simply <a href="man/vitunes-add.html">add</a>
      your moved files again.
   </dd>

   <dt>For some songs, the percent-complete in the player window is always
   negative?</dt>
   <dd>
      When vitunes extracts the meta-information from songs, including
      playlength, it uses <a href="http://taglib.github.io/">TagLib</a>. If
      TagLib isn't able to determine the play length of the file, vitunes will
      attempt to determine the length when loading the file, but this isn't
      always possible either. In these cases, the percent will be negative.
   </dd>

   <dt>How do I backup the vitunes database?</dt>
   <dd>
      Just copy the <code>~/.vitunes/</code> directory.  If you have your
      database/playlists stored elsewhere, just backup those.
   </dd>

   <dt>Can I have my database/playlists/config-file stored elsewhere?</dt>
   <dd>Yes.  Use the <code>-d</code>, <code>-p</code>, and <code>-f</code> flags
      as described in the <a href="man/vitunes.html">man page</a>.
   </dd>

   <dt>I have an old version of vitunes with an existing database.  When I run the new
      version, it tells me to rebuild my database.  How do I do this?</dt>
   <dd>
      I had to slightly change the format of the database for this new version.  Also,
      I never included any version information in the previous format.
      This has now been changed.  To upgrade an existing setup, download the most recent
      version below and 1) remove the existing database, 2) re-init the database, then
      3) re-add all of your files. e.g.
      <pre>
         $ rm ~/.vitunes/vitunes.db
         $ vitunes -e init
         $ vitunes -e add <i>/path/to/music/</i> <i>...</i></pre>
   </dd>

   <dt>Adding regular files to the database is easy, but adding URL's is somewhat painful.
      Is there an easy way to automate this?</dt>
   <dd>
      Of course!  You're using *nix, so use a shell script to add all of your URL's,
      like this one: <a href="add_urls.sh"><code>add_urls.sh</code></a>.
   </dd>

   <dt>When exiting vitunes, it seems to hang for one half-second.  Why?</dt>
   <dd>
      This is intentional.  The <code>fork()'d</code> mplayer child will
      <code>fork()</code> an instance of itself whenever it plays an internet
      radio stream (or similar) to handle the buffering.  As such, vitunes needs
      to wait for this &lsquo;grandchild&rsquo; instance of mplayer to exit
      before quitting.

<h3 class="uk-h3">Bugs &amp; Other Questions</h3>

<dl class="faq">

   <dt>I think I found a bug... what should I do?</dt>
   <dd>
      First, do the following, in this order:
      <ol>
         <li>Read the <a href="man/vitunes.html">man page</a> (humor me)</li>
         <li>Read the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li>
         <li>Search the mailing list archives to see if your &ldquo;bug&rdquo;
            has popped-up before.</li>
         <li>Search the
            <a href="https://github.com/ryanflannery/vitunes/issues">Bug/Issue
            database</a> to see if your bug is already known, and if so, add a
            comment that you too are experiencing it.  Provide as many details
            as possible.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      If you've done the above and haven't found your bug/issue mentioned and
      resolved elsewhere, then email either the mailing list or
      <a href="mailto:ryan.flannery@gmail.com">me</a>, and include
      an extremely detailed description of your bug and how to reproduce it.
   </dd>

   <dt>After a song finishes playing, the next song isn't automatically
   started.</dt>
   <dd>
      Most likely you're on a Linux distro with an older version of mplayer.
      You need mplayer version 1.0rc3 or greater.  Alternatively, any version of
      mplayer built from a checkout of the source <i>after</i> December 29,
      2009 will work.
   </dd>

   <dt>The cursor is always visible, even when I'm not in command mode... what
   gives?</dt>
   <dd>
   This is most likely a mis-configured <code>$TERM</code> environment variable.
   Specifically, it's set to something that does not support this particular
   feature.  See the documentation for your OS &amp; terminal emulator (e.g.
   xterm/rxvt/etc.) for what this should be set to.  Note that
   &ldquo;<code>xterm-color</code>&rdquo; almost always has limitations (see
   <a href="http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#xterm_color">here</a>
   for more information).
   <br /><br />
   On OpenBSD pre <b>4.7</b>, your <code>$TERM</code> variable, when using
   <code>xterm</code>, should always be set to <code>xterm-xfree86</code>.
   After <b>4.7</b>, just leave your <code>$TERM</code> variable alone.
   </dd>

   <dt>Scrolling, redrawing, and resizing are all very slow. Is this
   normal?</dt>
   <dd>
      If you're using an <i>actual</i>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100"><code>VT100</code></a> (or
      similar) <i>or</i> if you have 1,000,000,000,000+ songs in your library,
      then yes. Otherwise, no. This is mostly likely a misconfigured
      <code>$TERM</code> environment variable. See the previous FAQ entry.

   <dt>What license is vitunes distributed under?</dt>
   <dd>
      <a href="LICENSE.txt">ISC</a>.
