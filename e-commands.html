<b>VITUNES COMMAND:</b>
	init - initialize vitunes directories/database

<b>SYNOPSIS:</b>
	init

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
   The init command is used to setup the initial files and directories
   used by vitunes.  This includes:

      ~/.vitunes              The vitunes core directory where everything
                              is stored.
      ~/.vitunes/vitunes.db   The library database containing the meta
                              information of all media files.
      ~/.vitunes/playlists/   Directory where all playlists are stored.

   The database created is initially empty.
   If any of the above files/directories exists, nothing will be changed.
   This command takes no parameters.

   It is not strictly necessary to run this command to start using
   vitunes, as you could use an existing installation, or create the
   files/directories yourself.  It is provided for convenience.

<b>EXAMPLE:</b>
      $ vitunes -e init








<a name="add"></a>
<b>VITUNES COMMAND:</b>
	add - add files to the vitunes database

<b>SYNOPSIS:</b>
	add /path/to/files1 [ path2 ... ]

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
   The add command is used to add files to the database used by vitunes.
   For every file/directory provided as a parameter, vitunes will scan that
   file or directory (recursively) searching for media files that contain
   any meta information.  Any such files found are added to the database
   used by vitunes.  If any of the files found are already in the database
   then they will be re-scanned and any changes will be updated.

   Note that vitunes only maintains information about the file, and not the
   file itself.  It does NOT move/copy/modify the files in its database in
   any way.

   The information vitunes stores for each file includes:
      *  Filename                *  Track Number
      *  Artist Name             *  Year
      *  Album Name              *  Genre
      *  Song/Video Title        *  Play Length (seconds)

   The filename stored is the absolute pathname obtained from realpath(3),
   and serves as the key-field within the database.

   If any file encountered has no meta information, it is NOT added to the
   database.

<b>EXAMPLE:</b>
   $ vitunes -e add ~/music /usr/local/share/music








<a name="addurl"></a>
<b>VITUNES COMMAND:</b>
	addurl - add a URL (or other) to the vitunes database

<b>SYNOPSIS:</b>
	addurl URL

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
   To add non-standard-files to the vitunes database (things like URL's for
   Internet radio streams), one can use the addurl command. It takes a single
   parameter: the URL/filename to be added to the database. After that, you
   will be prompted to enter meta-information for each field vitunes indexes
   (artist, album, title, track, year, and genre). You may leave any/all of
   the fields blank.

   Basically, anything "foo" that mplayer can play by a simple:
      $ mplayer foo
   can be added to the database using this command.  Although regular files
   could also be added using this command, the add command is preferred, as
   it attempts to extract meta information automatically.

   Note that files added to the database using the addurl command are NOT
   checked for updates during an update command.

   Note that the addurl command can also be used to change the meta-
   information of an existing URL within the database.

<b>EXAMPLE:</b>
   $ vitunes -e addurl "http://198.234.121.118:80"
   Artist: WVXU Online Radio<b style="color: magenta;">&lt;ENTER&gt;</b>
    Album: Cincinnati Public Radio<b style="color: magenta;">&lt;ENTER&gt;</b>
    Title: NPR<b style="color: magenta;">&lt;ENTER&gt;</b>
    Track: <b style="color: magenta;">&lt;ENTER&gt;</b>
     Year: <b style="color: magenta;">&lt;ENTER&gt;</b>
    Genre: Radio<b style="color: magenta;">&lt;ENTER&gt;</b>
   Length: INF<b style="color: magenta;">&lt;ENTER&gt;</b>

<b>NOTES:</b>
   When the vitunes database has to be re-built (because of say, an upgrade
   where the database format has changed, or you simply deleted your
   database), re-adding URL's can be tedious.  To ease this, consider using
   a shell script such as the 'add_urls.sh' script found on the vitunes
   website for storing & adding all of your URL's.  The script simply
   executes the addurl command with all meta-information provided.  As an
   example, the above EXAMPLE could be automated as:

      #!/bin/sh
      echo "WVXU Online Radio\n\
      Cincinnati Public Radio\n\
      NPR\n\
      \n\
      \n\
      Radio\n\
      INF\n" | vitunes -e addurl "http://198.234.121.118:80"








<a name="check"></a>
<b>VITUNES COMMAND:</b>
	check - check files for meta-info and if they're in the DB

<b>SYNOPSIS:</b>
	check [-rsd] file1 [ file2 ... ]

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
   The check command will scan each filename provided to see to see if
   vitunes can extract any meta-information, to see how vitunes "sanitizes"
   the meta-information (see below), or what information vitunes currently has
   in the database for this file.

   Note that at least one of the -r, -s, or -d flags must be present.

   The options are as follows:

   -r    Show the raw information extracted directly from each file.

   -s    Show the sanitized information after extracting it from each file.
         See the section SANITATION below for details on what this is.

   -d    Load the vitunes database and check if the each exists within it.
         If so, show the information in the vitunes database.

   If multiple files are provided, each will be checked in order.

<b>SANITATION:</b>
   By "sanitation" above, the following is meant: some media files have
   non-printable characters in their meta information for one reason or
   another (often, it's a faulty ripper/tagging application).  Sometimes
   these non-printable characters can be control sequences used by [n]curses
   and thus cause problems with the curses display of vitunes.  The way
   vitunes sanitizes such data is to replace all such control characters with
   an '?'.

<b>EXAMPLE:</b>
   $ vitunes -e check -r /path/to/file.mp3








<a name="rmfile"></a>
<b>VITUNES COMMAND:</b>
	rm - remove a single file/URL from the vitunes database

<b>SYNOPSIS:</b>
	rm [-f] filename/URL

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
   To remove a single file/URL from the vitunes database, the rm command may
   be used.  It takes a single parameter: the filename/URL of the file to
   remove.  Normally, you will be prompted if you are sure you want to
   remove the file as a safety measure.  This prompt can be avoided using
   the '-f' flag, to force the removal.

   Note that to remove files, the full, absolute path to the file must be
   provided, as obtained from realpath(3).

<b>EXAMPLE:</b>
   $ vitunes -e rm -f "http://198.234.121.118/listen.pls"

<b>ALIAS:</b>
	rmfile  -  As e-commands, "rmfile" and "rm" are interchangeable.








<a name="update"></a>
<b>VITUNES COMMAND:</b>
	update - update vitunes database

<b>SYNOPSIS:</b>
	update [-s]

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
   The update command loads the existing meta information database used
   by vitunes and for each media file listed in the database, the file is
   checked to see if it has been removed or modified since it was added
   to the database.

   If the file has been removed, it will be removed from the database.  If
   the file has been modified, it's meta information will be extracted
   again and the database will be updated.
   Note that if there are errors while checking the file, the error will be
   reported but the file, and its meta information, will remain in the
   vitunes database.

      -s       When present, files that are skipped because they have not
               been modified will also be reported to stdout.  Normally,
               only files that are updated are reported.

   In short, anytime you remove/modify media files already in the vitunes
   database, you should run this command.

<b>NOTE ABOUT URLS:</b>
   Note that files added to the database using the 'addurl' e-command will
   NOT be checked/updated in any way, for obvious reasons.

<b>EXAMPLE:</b>
      $ vitunes -e update








<a name="flush"></a>
<b>VITUNES COMMAND:</b>
	flush - dump output of vitunes database to terminal

<b>SYNOPSIS:</b>
	flush [-t time-format]

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
   The flush command simply outputs the contents of the meta-information
   database used by vitunes to stdout, in a fairly easy to read (but very
   easy to parse/grep through) format.

   The one optional parameter, time-format, can be any string acceptable
   to strftime(3) and is used when displaying the 'last-updated' field of
   each record in the database (when the file was last checked for meta-
   information).

   The format used is a simple comma-separated-value (CSV) one, where most
   fields (any that can contain spaces/commas) are within double quotes.
   The first line contains the field names, and those fields that are quoted
   are also quoted in this header row.

<b>EXAMPLE:</b>
   $ vitunes -e flush

   To see which files were last updated this month:
   $ vitunes -e flush -t "%M %Y" | grep "January 2010"

   output of this command, you can visit the following website:

<a name="tag"></a>
<b>VITUNES COMMAND:</b>
	tag - set meta-information tags to raw files

<b>SYNOPSIS:</b>
	tag [--artist=string] [-a string] [--album=string] [-A value]
	    [--title=string] [-t string] [--genre=string] [-g string]
	    [--track=number] [-T number] [--year=number] [-y number]
	    [--comment=string] [-c string]
	    file1 [ file2 ... ]

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
   The tag command is provided to add/change the meta-information tags of
   media files.  The meta-information fields that can be set are: artist,
   album, title, genre, track, and year.

   Please note that this command only changes the meta-information in the
   raw files themselves and NOT in the vitunes database.  To update the
   vitunes database after tagging, use the 'update' e-command.

   The tag command takes a series of field/value specifiers and any number
   of files.  For each file specified, the given field will be set to the
   provided value.

   The options are as follows:

   --artist=string
   -a string            Sets the artist field to the provided string.

   --album=string
   -A string            Sets the album field to the provided string.

   --title=string
   -t string            Sets the title field to the provided string.

   --genre=string
   -g string            Sets the genre field to the provided string.

   --comment=string
   -c string            Sets the comment field to the provided string.

   --track=number
   -T number            Sets the track field to the provided number.
                        Note that the number must be between 0 and
                        INT_MAX.

   --year=number
   -y number            Sets the year field to the provided number.
                        Note that the number must be between 0 and
                        INT_MAX.

   At least one tag option must be provided and at least one file must
   be provided.

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>
   Just to reiterate a comment above, this command only changes the meta-
   information in the raw files themselves and NOT in the vitunes database.
   To update the vitunes database after tagging, use the 'update' or 'add'
   e-commands.

<b>EXAMPLE:</b>
   CD rippers frequently pull information from CDDB (or other databases)
   where, for example, a "The" is missing from an artist/album name
   when it is, in fact, appropriate.  Below is an example of correcting
   this and then updating the vitunes database:

   $ vitunes -e tag --artist="The White Stripes" /path/to/De_Stijl/*
   $ vitunes -e update
