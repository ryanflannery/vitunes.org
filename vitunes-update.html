VITUNES-UPDATE(1)         BSD General Commands Manual        VITUNES-UPDATE(1)

<span class="bold">NAME</span>
     <span class="bold">vitunes-update</span> -- update all files in the database

<span class="bold">SYNOPSIS</span>
     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">update</span> [<span class="bold">-fs</span>]

<span class="bold">DESCRIPTION</span>
     The <span class="bold">update</span> e-command loads the existing vitunes(1) database and for each
     file listed, the file is checked to see if it has been removed or modi-
     fied since it was added to the database or last updated.  If the file has
     been removed, it will be removed from the database.  If the file has been
     modified, it's meta-information will be extracted again and the database
     will be updated.

     Note that if there are errors while checking any file, the error will be
     reported but such files, and their meta-information, will remain in the
     database.

     The options are as follows:

     <span class="bold">-f</span>          Force the update of meta-information of all files, even if
                 their modification times haven't changed.

     <span class="bold">-s</span>          When present, files that are skipped because they have not
                 been modified will also be reported to stdout(4).  Normally,
                 only files that are updated are reported.

     Anytime media files are removed/modified which are already in the
     vitunes(1) database, the <span class="bold">update</span> e-command should be used.

<span class="bold">NOTES</span>
     Any files/URLs added to the database using the <span class="bold">addurl</span> e-command will <span class="bold">not</span>
     be checked/updated in any way, for obvious reasons.

<span class="bold">EXAMPLES</span>
     To scan all files in the vitunes(1) database for updates, simply use:

           $ vitunes -e update

<span class="bold">SEE</span> <span class="bold">ALSO</span>
