<b>Big Changes:</b>
   * Almost a complete re-write of vitunes.
   * Many ugly bugs with the display (like resizing) have been fixed.
   * Many more vi(1) keybindings supported.
   * <i>Much</i> more customizable with various commands below, all of which
     can be stored in a configuration file to be applied automatically when vitunes loads.
   * Fixed a particularly nasty bug caused when displaying files whose meta information
     contained curses control sequences.

<b>Notable New Features:</b>
