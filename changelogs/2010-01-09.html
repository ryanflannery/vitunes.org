<big>Changelog: 2010-01-09: 1.0.2 Release</big>

<b>Bug-Fixes:</b>
   *  If the child instance of mplayer is killed, it is now automatically
      re-launched and playback continues where it left off
   *  If mplayer fork()'s an instance of itself (it does this when playing
      internet streams), this grandchild instance of mplayer is now killed
      on exit also.
   *  *much* better signal handling... :)

<b>New Features:</b>
   *  Added keybinding 's' to stop playback
   *  The '^y' keybinding now works
   *  Can now be prompted on exit to save any playlist that have been sorted
      with the following option:
            :set save-sorts=true
      (click <a href="/#cmd_set">here</a> for details)
