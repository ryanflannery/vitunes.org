VITUNES(1)                 OpenBSD Reference Manual                 VITUNES(1)

<span class="bold">NAME</span>
     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> - A curses media indexer and player for vi-users

<span class="bold">SYNOPSIS</span>
     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> [<span class="bold">-d</span> <span class="underline">database-file</span>] [<span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="underline">command</span> [argument ...]] [<span class="bold">-f</span> <span class="underline">config-file</span>]
             [<span class="bold">-m</span> <span class="underline">media-backend</span>] [<span class="bold">-p</span> <span class="underline">playlist-dir</span>]

<span class="bold">DESCRIPTION</span>
     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> is a curses-based music player and playlist manager for *nix
     whose goals are a minimalistic appearance, strong vi-like bindings, and
     quick playlist creation/management.

     It is not intended to be a feature-rich media player, but rather a quick,
     vi-like media indexer and playlist manager that also happens to be able
     to play the media it indexes (via mplayer(1)).

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> accepts the following command line options:

     <span class="bold">-d</span> <span class="underline">database-file</span>
                 Specifies the database containing all known media files and
                 their meta information that <span class="bold">vitunes</span> should use.  If you're
                 using this option in conjunction with an e-command, this
                 option <span class="bold">must</span> be specified before the e-command.

                 The default location is <span class="underline">~/.vitunes/vitunes.db</span>.

     <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="underline">command</span> <span class="bold">options</span>
                 Execute one of the available e-commands to manipulate the
                 database that <span class="bold">vitunes</span> uses.  See the section below titled
                 <span class="underline">E-COMMANDS</span> for more information.

     <span class="bold">-c</span> <span class="underline">command</span>  Execute a command in the running <span class="bold">vitunes</span> instance.

     <span class="bold">-f</span> <span class="underline">config-file</span>
                 Specifies the path of the configuration file <span class="bold">vitunes</span> should
                 load.  See the section below titled <span class="underline">CONFIGURATION</span> <span class="underline">FILE</span> for
                 information on what the configuration may contain.

                 The default location is <span class="underline">~/.vitunes/vitunes.conf</span>.

     <span class="bold">-m</span> <span class="underline">media-backend</span>
                 Specify the media backend to use for playback.  The current
                 list of supported media backends are:

                 <span class="bold">mplayer</span>  Uses a fork(2) / execvp(3)'d instance of mplayer(1)
                          for all playback.  Note that the mplayer binary <span class="bold">must</span>
                          be in your PATH environment variable.

                 Currently only <span class="bold">mplayer</span> is supported.

     <span class="bold">-p</span> <span class="underline">playlist-dir</span>
                 Specifies the directory containing all of the playlists
                 <span class="bold">vitunes</span> will load and use.  Any new playlists created while
                 running <span class="bold">vitunes</span> will be created here.

                 The default location is <span class="underline">~/.vitunes/playlists/</span>.

   <span class="bold">Getting</span> <span class="bold">Started</span>
     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> works by maintaining a database of tagged media files.  The
     database <span class="bold">must</span> be created and populated before <span class="bold">vitunes</span> can be run
     normally.

     After that, files can be added, modified, or removed from the database,
     and on the next invocation, <span class="bold">vitunes</span> will see the changes (additionally,
     the database can be re-loaded at runtime).

     <span class="bold">o</span>   All database management is done using "e-commands", which are always
         of the form:
               $ vitunes -e command-name [parameters ...]

     <span class="bold">o</span>   Once the database has been created, <span class="bold">vitunes</span> can be run normally with
         the following:
               $ vitunes

     <span class="bold">o</span>   All playlist management is done while <span class="bold">vitunes</span> is running normally.

     See the <span class="underline">E-COMMANDS</span> section below for more information on database
     management.  To get started quickly, simply do the following:

     1.   Create initial empty database with
                $ vitunes -e init

     2.   Add files to your database with
                $ vitunes -e add ~/music/ /path/to/more/music/

     3.   Then just start normally with
                $ vitunes

   <span class="bold">The</span> <span class="bold">Display</span>
     When run normally, the default display will show the following 4 windows:

     player      This window occupies the top row of the display and contains
                 information about the currently playing song (if any) and the
                 current play-mode.

     command/status
                 This window occupies the bottom row of the display.  It
                 behaves very similar to the command/status window in vi(1).

     library     This window occupies the left-side of the screen and shows
                 each playlist, in addition to the library and filter-buffer.
                 The filter buffer is where the results of every :<span class="bold">filter</span> <span class="underline">...</span>
                 command are temporarily stored.
                 Playlists with unsaved changes appear bold and have their
                 name preceded with a '+'.

     playlist    This window is to the right of the library window and
                 occupies most of the display.  It shows the contents of
                 whichever playlist has currently been selected in the library
                 window.

   <span class="bold">Useful</span> <span class="bold">Keybindings</span>
     The following is only a partial listing keybindings, but are the most
     frequently used.

     <span class="bold">Enter</span>   Load the selected playlist for viewing or begin playback of the
             selected file.

     <span class="bold">Tab</span>     Toggle focus between the library and playlist windows.

     <span class="bold">z</span>       Pause playback.

     <span class="bold">s</span>       Stop playback.

     <span class="bold">f/b</span>     Seek forwards/backwards 10 seconds.

     <span class="bold">F/B</span>     Seek forwards/backwards 1 minute.

     <span class="bold">m</span>       In the playlist window, show/hide information for the current
             file.

     See the <span class="underline">KEYBINDING</span> <span class="underline">ACTIONS</span> section for a complete listing.

<span class="bold">E-COMMANDS</span>
     Below is a brief summary of each e-command available in <span class="bold">vitunes</span>.  More
     detailed usage information and examples for each can be obtained by
     issuing:
           $ vitunes -e help command-name

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">init</span>
             Create the necessary database file and playlist directory used by
             <span class="bold">vitunes</span>.  This command only needs to be run once, when <span class="bold">vitunes</span> is
             first run.  If either of these already exist, they remain
             unchanged.

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">add</span> <span class="underline">path1</span> [<span class="underline">path2</span> <span class="underline">...</span>]
             This command takes any number of files/directories as parameters.
             Each file is scanned for meta-information and if found, added to
             the database.  Directories are search recursively.

             TagLib(3) is used for all meta-extraction, which includes the
             following fields: album, artist, comment, play-length, title,
             track number, and year.

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">addurl</span> <span class="underline">url</span>
             This command is used to add non-files (things like URL's for
             Internet radio stations) to the database, where the meta-
             information cannot be determined automatically.  It can also be
             used to update the meta-info of an existing URL in the database.

             After executing, you are prompted to enter all of your own
             information.

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">check</span> [<span class="bold">-rsd</span>] <span class="underline">file1</span> [<span class="underline">file2</span> <span class="underline">...</span>]
             Scan the files specified and display their meta-information as
             present in the files themselves or in the <span class="bold">vitunes</span> database.  This
             is useful for checking if a file is in the database.

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">flush</span> [<span class="bold">-t</span> <span class="underline">time-format</span>]
             Dump the contents of the database to stdout in an easy-to-parse
             format, optionally with the specified strftime(3) compatible
             format for times.

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">help</span> <span class="underline">command</span>
             Display detailed usage information and examples for the e-command
             specified by <span class="underline">command</span>.

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">rm</span> [<span class="bold">-f</span>] <span class="underline">file/url</span>
             Remove a file/URL from the database.

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">rmfile</span> [<span class="bold">-f</span>] <span class="underline">file/url</span>
             Alias for the "rm" e-command.

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">tag</span> [options] <span class="underline">file1</span> [<span class="underline">file2</span> <span class="underline">...</span>]
             Add/modify the meta-information tags of raw files.  There are
             many options to this e-command.  See the help page for more
             information:
                   $ vitunes -e help tag

     <span class="bold">vitunes</span> <span class="bold">-e</span> <span class="bold">update</span> [<span class="bold">-s</span>]
             Load the existing database and check each file to see if its
             meta-information has been updated, or if the file has been
             removed.  The database is updated accordingly.

<span class="bold">RUN-TIME</span> <span class="bold">COMMANDS</span>
     Below is a listing of all run-time commands supported by <span class="bold">vitunes</span>.

     All commands are entered by typing ':' followed by the command name and
     any parameters (just like in vi(1)).

     Note that abbreviations are also supported.  That is, entering any non-
     ambiguous abbreviation of a command name will also execute the command.

     :<span class="bold">bind</span> <span class="underline">action</span> <span class="underline">keycode</span>
             This will bind the action specified by <span class="underline">action</span> to the keycode
             specified by <span class="underline">keycode</span>.  After this command is issued, entering the
             inputting the specified <span class="underline">keycode</span> will result in firing the
             specified <span class="underline">action</span>.

             See the section <span class="underline">SPECIFYING</span> <span class="underline">KEYCODES</span> for details on how to specify
             <span class="underline">keycode</span>, and section <span class="underline">KEYBINDING</span> <span class="underline">ACTIONS</span> for a listing of all
             actions <span class="bold">vitunes</span> supports.

     :<span class="bold">color</span> <span class="bold">item</span>=<span class="underline">fg</span>,<span class="underline">bg</span>
             Change the color of the given <span class="bold">item</span> to <span class="underline">fg</span> colored text on a <span class="underline">bg</span>

                                     window.
                   <span class="bold">tildas-playlist</span>   The tildas in empty rows of the playlist
                                     window.
                   <span class="bold">playing-library</span>   Currently playing playlist in the library
                                     window.
                   <span class="bold">playing-playlist</span>  Currently playing file in the playlist
                                     window.
                   <span class="bold">current-inactive</span>  Current row in the inactive window.
                   <span class="bold">artist</span>            The artist column in the playlist window.
                   <span class="bold">album</span>             The album column in the playlist window.
                   <span class="bold">title</span>             The title column in the playlist window.
                   <span class="bold">track</span>             The track column in the playlist window.
                   <span class="bold">year</span>              The year column in the playlist window.
                   <span class="bold">genre</span>             The genre column in the playlist window.
                   <span class="bold">comment</span>           The comment column in the playlist
                                     window.
                   <span class="bold">length</span>            The play-length column in the playlist
                                     window.

             Available colors for <span class="underline">fg</span> and <span class="underline">bg</span> are: white, black, red, green,
             yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and default.  The color default is
             whatever the terminal uses as the default foreground or
             background color.

     :<span class="bold">display</span> (<span class="bold">reset</span> | <span class="bold">show</span> | <span class="underline">display-description</span>)
             The display command is used to change which columns are displayed
             in the playlist window, their order, their width, and their
             alignment.

             The format of <span class="underline">display-description</span> is a comma separated list of:
             "[<span class="underline">-</span>]<span class="underline">field</span>.<span class="underline">size</span>".

             Valid values for <span class="underline">field</span> are: album, artist, comment, genre,
             length, title, track, and year.  The <span class="underline">size</span> field indicates the
             number of columns.  If <span class="underline">field</span> is preceded with a <span class="underline">-</span> the field will
             be right-aligned.  As an example, the command:

             :<span class="bold">display</span> <span class="underline">title.10,artist.20,-track.4</span>

             would only show the title, artist, and track fields, in that
             order, where the title field is 10 columns wide, the artist field
             is 20 columns wide, and the track field is 4 columns wide and
             right-aligned.

             The default display can be restored with:

             :<span class="bold">display</span> <span class="bold">reset</span>

             The current display description can be seen with:

             :<span class="bold">display</span> <span class="bold">show</span>

     :<span class="bold">filter</span>[!] <span class="underline">token</span> [<span class="underline">token2</span> <span class="underline">...</span>]
             The filter command is used to filter out all songs from the
             currently viewed playlist that do not match (or do match) the
             provided list of tokens.  A song matches the list of tokens if
             each token appears somewhere in the song's meta-information or
             filename.

             If ":<span class="bold">filter</span>" is used, all records not matching the list of tokens
             are removed from the current playlist.  If ":<span class="bold">filter!</span>" is used,
             all records that do match the list of tokens are removed from the
             current playlist.

             The list of tokens is simply any list of strings, each possibly
             preceded with an exclamation point.  If a token is preceded with
             an exclamation point, it will only match a song if it does not
             appear anywhere in the song's meta-information or filename.

             For example, the following:

             :<span class="bold">filter</span> <span class="underline">nine</span> <span class="underline">nails</span>

             would match all songs that contained both "nine" and "nails", and
             remove all other songs from the current playlist.  However,

             :<span class="bold">filter!</span> <span class="underline">nine</span> <span class="underline">nails</span>

             would remove all songs that DO contain both "nine" and "nails."

             The query:

             :<span class="bold">filter</span> <span class="underline">nine</span> <span class="underline">!nails</span>

             would match all songs that contain "nine" and NOT "nails".  All
             other songs would be removed from the current playlist.

     :<span class="bold">mode</span> (<span class="bold">linear</span> | <span class="bold">loop</span> | <span class="bold">random</span>)
             Set the current playmode to one of the three available options.
             The options are:

             <span class="bold">linear</span>      Songs in a playlist are played in the order they
                         appear until the end is reached.

             <span class="bold">loop</span>        Like linear, but when the end of the playlist is
                         reached, playback continues at the beginning of the
                         playlist.

             <span class="bold">random</span>      Songs are chosen at random from the playlist.

     :<span class="bold">new</span> [<span class="underline">name</span>]
             Create a new, empty playlist.  If <span class="underline">name</span> is provided, the new
             playlist will be named accordingly unless a playlist with that
             name already exists.  If no name is provided, the default is
             "untitled".

     :<span class="bold">q</span>[!]   Quit <span class="bold">vitunes</span>.  If there are playlists with unsaved changes, then
             you are notified of this and prevented from quitting.  You can
             forcefully quit by using :<span class="bold">q</span>!, and any unsaved changes to any
             playlists will be lost.

             Note that playlists with unsaved changes appear bold in the
             library window.

     :<span class="bold">reload</span> (<span class="bold">db</span> | <span class="bold">conf</span>)
             The reload command is used to reload either the database or
             configuration file while <span class="bold">vitunes</span> is running.  Handy if you update
             your database using an e-command while also running <span class="bold">vitunes</span>.

     :<span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">property</span>=<span class="underline">value</span>
             The set command is used to set various properties within vitunes.
             For properties that accept a value of <span class="underline">bool</span>, valid values are
             'true' and 'false'.

             The following properties are available:

             <span class="bold">lhide</span>=<span class="underline">bool</span>  If set to true, the library window will be hidden
                         (disappear) when it does not have focus.

             <span class="bold">lwidth</span>=<span class="underline">number</span>
                         Set the width of the library window to <span class="underline">number</span> columns
                         wide.  Note that the number provided must be greater
                         than 0 and less than the width of the terminal.

             <span class="bold">match-fname</span>=<span class="underline">bool</span>
                         When searching or filtering a playlist, normally the
                         filenames are also included in the matching
                         algorithm.  This can sometimes be undesirable,
                         particularly if, for example, all of your music/media
                         reside in a directory named "media" and you're trying
                         to search for a file with the word "media" in the
                         title.

                         To disable this behavior, set match-fnames to false.

             <span class="bold">save-sorts</span>=<span class="underline">bool</span>
                         Most operations that change a playlist (such as
                         paste/cut) set the 'needs-saving' flag on the
                         playlist, such that you are prompted on exiting
                         vitunes that there is a playlist with unsaved
                         changes.  By default, sorting a playlist does not do
                         this.

                         To change this behavior, and be prompted to save
                         sorts on exit, set this option to true.

     :<span class="bold">sort</span> <span class="underline">sort-description</span>
             Sort the currently viewing playlist using the provided
             <span class="underline">sort-description</span>, which is a comma separated list of: "[<span class="underline">-</span>]<span class="underline">field</span>",
             specifying which fields to sort by and if they should be sorted
             ascending or descending.

             Valid values for <span class="underline">field</span> are: album, artist, comment, genre,
             length, title, track, and year.  Each field is sorted ascending
             by default, unless the field is preceeded with the dash <span class="underline">-</span>, in
             which case that field is sorted descending.

             As an example, the following command:

             <span class="bold">:sort</span> <span class="bold">artist,-album,title</span>

             would sort all records in the current playlist by artist
             (ascending) first, then album-name (descending), then title
             (ascending).

             Note that while most operations on playlists set the "needs-
             saving" flag (so you are prompted when quiting <span class="bold">vitunes</span> that the
             playlist has unsaved changes), sorting a playlist does not do
             this.  This is intentional.  If you wish this behavior to be
             changed, see the "save-sorts" option for the <span class="bold">set</span> command.

     :<span class="bold">toggle</span> <span class="underline">register</span> <span class="underline">command-list</span>
             This command will associate a list of commands specified by
             <span class="underline">command-list</span> to register <span class="underline">register</span>.  Once set, the list of
             commands can be quickly toggled through using the <span class="bold">toggle_forward</span>
             and <span class="bold">toggle_backward</span> keybindings (which default to <span class="bold">t</span> and <span class="bold">T</span>,
             respectively).

             Toggle-lists can be useful to quickly alternate through, for
             example, various sorting or display schemes that the user may
             prefer.

             <span class="underline">register</span> is any single lower-case letter (a - z) or uppercase
             letter (A - Z).  <span class="underline">command-list</span> is any list of valid commands
             listed here, each separated by a backslash character '/'.

             As an example, the following would allow one to quickly toggle
             through various sorting schemes:

             <span class="bold">toggle</span> <span class="bold">s</span> <span class="bold">sort</span> <span class="bold">artist,-year,track</span> <span class="bold">/</span> <span class="bold">sort</span> <span class="bold">artist,album,track</span> <span class="bold">/</span> <span class="bold">sort</span>
             <span class="bold">-year</span>

             Once issued, the three individual sorts specified above can be
             toggled using the <span class="underline">s</span> register.  With the default keybindings this
             would be done using either <span class="underline">ts</span> (to toggle forward through the
             list) or <span class="underline">Ts</span> (to toggle backward through the list).

     :<span class="bold">unbind</span> (<span class="bold">*</span> | <span class="bold">action</span> <span class="underline">action</span> | <span class="bold">key</span> <span class="underline">keycode</span>)
             This command is used to remove existing keybindings.  It has
             three forms.  The first is simply:

             <span class="bold">unbind</span> <span class="underline">*</span>

             which will remove all existing keybindings.  This is handy in a
             configuration file where you may want to define all custom
             keybindings.  Issuing this at runtime will leave you with an
             instance of <span class="bold">vitunes</span> that will not respond to any keybdings!

             The second form is used to unbind actions:

             <span class="bold">unbind</span> <span class="bold">action</span> <span class="underline">action</span>

             This will remove any keybindings for the action specified by
             <span class="underline">action</span>.

             The third form is used to unbind keys:

             <span class="bold">unbind</span> <span class="bold">key</span> <span class="underline">keycode</span>

             This will remove any action currently bound to the key specified
             by <span class="underline">keycode</span>.

             See the section <span class="underline">SPECIFYING</span> <span class="underline">KEYCODES</span> for details on how to specify
             <span class="underline">keycode</span>, and section <span class="underline">KEYBINDING</span> <span class="underline">ACTIONS</span> for a listing of all
             actions <span class="bold">vitunes</span> supports.

     :<span class="bold">w</span>[!] [<span class="underline">name</span>]
             Save the currently viewing playlist.  If a <span class="underline">name</span> is provided, then
             the playlist will be saved with this new name.  If, however, a
             playlist already exists with that name, then you will be
             prevented from saving with that name unless '!' is provided, in
             which case the existing playlist with that name will be deleted.

<span class="bold">SPECIFYING</span> <span class="bold">KEYCODES</span>
     This section describes how to specify keycodes used in both the :<span class="bold">bind</span> and
     :<span class="bold">unbind</span> commands.

     Keycodes are specified in the following fashion:

           [<span class="bold">Control</span>] (<span class="underline">key</span> | <span class="underline">SpecialKey</span>)

     Here, <span class="underline">key</span> is used to specify the actual, printable character entered
     which is case-sensitive (e.g. 'j', 'p', 'P'), and <span class="underline">SpecialKey</span> is used to
     specify various non-printable characters (such as the Page-Up key).

     If the string "Control" is also specified, then the keycode only applies
     when the control key is pressed in conjunction with the <span class="underline">key</span> or
     <span class="underline">SpecialKey</span>.

     Although <span class="bold">key</span> is case-sensitive ('p' and 'P' are treated differently),
     both <span class="underline">SpecialKey</span> and "Control" are case-insensitive.

     The currently supported list of non-printable characters available for
     <span class="underline">SpecialKey</span> are:

           <span class="underline">Value</span>     <span class="underline">Description</span>
           <span class="bold">PageUp</span>    The page-up key.
           <span class="bold">PageDown</span>  The page-down key.
           <span class="bold">Up</span>        The up-arrow key.
           <span class="bold">Down</span>      The down-arrow key.
           <span class="bold">Left</span>      The left-arrow key.
           <span class="bold">Right</span>     The right-arrow key.
           <span class="bold">Backspace</span> The backspace key.
           <span class="bold">Enter</span>     The enter key.
           <span class="bold">Space</span>     The space key.
           <span class="bold">Tab</span>       The tab key.

     Some examples of using keycodes and the :<span class="bold">bind</span> run-time command are:

        bind  paste_after   p
        bind  paste_before  P

        bind  scroll_up_halfpage    Control u
        bind  scroll_down_halfpage  Control d

<span class="bold">KEYBINDING</span> <span class="bold">ACTIONS</span>
     The current list of available actions that keys may be bound to is the
     following.  For each action, the default keys bound to them are also
     listed.

     <span class="underline">Action</span> <span class="underline">Name</span>            <span class="underline">Description</span>

                            For now, only 'gg' is supported, and this takes
                            you to the first line in the current window's

     Some examples of using the above actions and keycodes to define the
     default keybdings are:

        bind  paste_after   p

        bind  scroll_up_halfpage    Control u
        bind  scroll_down_halfpage  Control d

<span class="bold">CONFIGURATION</span> <span class="bold">FILE</span>
     The configuration file loaded by <span class="bold">vitunes</span> is relatively straight-forward.
     Each line may be one of the following:

     <span class="bold">o</span>   A comment, which starts with a '#'.
     <span class="bold">o</span>   An empty line.
     <span class="bold">o</span>   One of the commands from the <span class="underline">RUN-TIME</span> <span class="underline">COMMANDS</span> section above.

     That's it.  As such, review the list of commands above.

     An example configuration file that would setup some hideous DOS-like
     colors is:

        # setup colors
        color bars=white,blue
        color player=yellow,blue
        color library=green,blue
        color playlist=white,blue
        color status=red,blue

        # format for playlist window
        display artist.20,album.20,title.20,track.4,year.4

        # show most recent work of an artist first in library window
        sort artist,-year

        # make library window 20 columns wide and hide when not active
        set lwidth=20
        set lhide=true

<span class="bold">FILES</span>
     <span class="underline">~/.vitunes/vitunes.conf</span>
             Default configuration file.
     <span class="underline">~/.vitunes/vitunes.db</span>
             Default database file.
     <span class="underline">~/.vitunes/playlists/</span>
             Default playlist directory.
     <span class="underline">/usr/local/bin/mplayer</span>
             Default path to the mplayer(1) binary.

<span class="bold">SEE</span> <span class="bold">ALSO</span>
     mplayer(1), realpath(3), strftime(3), vi(1).
