      <div class="body">
         No news regarding vitunes itself, however I did refactor the site to
         use <a href="http://getuikit.com">uikit</a>, which I would
         <i>highly</i> recommend -- it's a great less-based, component framework
         that, imho, is much easier and more responsive than bootstrap et alia.

      <div class="title">Version 2.3 Released</div>
      <div class="uk-badge uk-badge-success">v2.3</div>
      <div class="body">
         First release in over a year, consisting entirely of work over 6 months
         old (much by others) that I never got around to pushing out.
         Multiple new features, performance improvements, and bugfixes. Notable
         new features include toggle-lists, allowing one to quickly toggle
         through sets of commands, such as various sort or display schemas.
         One can now also control a running instance of vitunes remoltely, using
         the new <code>-c command</code> option, allowing vitunes to be
         controlled remotely.

         With end-of-quarter grading, research, job-hunting, and dealing with my
         University closing my department (Computer Science.... !?!?!?), I'll be
         rather busy for the next few weeks and unable to contribute to the

      <div class="title">Linux Support Now Working out-of-the-box</div>
      <div class="body">
         With much thanks to Daniel Walter and Peter Polacik, vitunes now
         compiles and runs on Linux!  It requires a newer version of mplayer on
         Debian, and has some compile warnings (working on that), but it works!
         <br />
         Mplayer version 1.0rc3 or later will do.  Alternatively, any version
         built with a checkout of the source <em>after</em> December 27, 2009
         should do.

      <div class="uk-badge uk-badge-success">v2.2</div>
      <div class="body">
         This release adds no new functional features from version 2.1.  It does
         include a much better man-page and a build that works on Mac OS X.
         That's it.

      <div class="title">Call for testing: Mac OS X Support</div>
      <div class="body">
         In the past few days I have added support for a clean build on Mac OS
         X.  That is, vitunes should build cleanly, as-is, on a Mac. Only the
         following needs addressing by any Mac users:
         <ul>
            <li>
               Update the install locations in the Makefile
               (<code>PREFIX</code>) appropriately.
            </li>
            <li>
               <del>Edit the <code>LDFLAGS</code> variable in the Makefile to
               include <code>-lncursesw</code> rather than
               <code>-lncurses</code>.</del>
            </li>
            <li>
               Either manually modify the <code>DEFAULT_PLAYER_PATH</code>
               variable in <code>config.h</code>, <em>or</em> simply run vitunes
               with the <code>-m</code> flag and a proper path to
               <code>mplayer</code>.
            </li>
         </ul>
         With this, it should be rather trivial for a porter to get this into
         either <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a> or similar.
         <br /><br />
         Thanks to Joshua Conner and Andr&eacute; Berger for their help.
         <br /><br />
         <em>NOTE:</em> This isn't in any release yet, including the most
         recent, as it still needs heavy testing.

      <div class="title">Version 2.1 Released: Bugfix Release</div>
      <div class="uk-badge uk-badge-success">v2.1</div>
      <div class="body">
         There were some rather nasty formatting errors with the man page that
         shipped with the 2.0 release a few days ago. They didn't show up during
         testing (e.g. with &ldquo;<code>mandoc vitunes.1 | less</code>&rdquo;),
         but did after installation (with
         &ldquo;<code>man vitunes</code>&rdquo;).

      <div class="title">Version 2.0 Released</div>
      <div class="uk-badge uk-badge-success">v2.0</div>
      <div class="body">
         Version 2.0 is officially released.  Many new features, including
         support for custom keybindings (via the bind and unbind commands),
         undo/redo support, vastly improved synchronization between vitunes and
         mplayer, new display elements that are colorable, and new keybindings.
         <br /><br />
         This brings vitunes almost to a completion, at least in terms of what I
         always wanted it to be.  I'll be maintaining it indefinitely since I
         use it heavily, but I don't really foresee any major new features.  If
         you have ideas, let me know.
         <br /><br />
         Happy 2011!

      <div class="title">Massive Re-Write Underway</div>
      <div class="body">
         So my &ldquo;minor clean-up and a few feature additions&rdquo; has
         turned into a hackathon on my part. It rocks. Far better
         synchronization with <code>mplayer</code> (less skipping), undo/redo
         support, <code>:map</code> to create custom keybindings, more
         color-able stuff, support for the comment-field of media files, and
         cleaner syntax for all commands are all in the works.
         <br /><br />
         Unfortunately, these updates will either break compatability with
         previous versions of vitunes or require super-extra-massive effort on
         my part to make it backwards compatable by adding loads of goey goey c.
         Pondering...
         <br /><br />
         For the daring sort, you can use one of the repositories listed above
         to get a copy of the current development version and build yer own.
         And hey, if you just feel like contributing something back, that'd be
         sweet.

      <div class="uk-badge uk-badge-success">v1.0.5</div>
      <div class="body">
         New release, 1.0.5 made today. A simple documentation cleanup. The man
         page and output of all <code>vitunes -e help COMMAND</code> have been
         made more complete. The man page is now the sole source of
         documentation (although the complete list of keybindings will remain
         here on the website, maintained, at least for now).

      <div class="title">Podcast Support?</div>
      <div class="body">
         I'm contemplating adding podcast support.  I don't wish to have vitunes
         automatically download any files within a podcast (a simple shell
         script, or any number of other existing utilities could be used for
         that).  Rather, i'd like vitunes to just parse an RSS feed, extract
         info to view in vitunes, and pass the filenames to mplayer (mplayer
         handles URL's quite nicely).
         <br /><br />
         vitunes users: any good ideas on how to integrate this into the vitunes
         ui?  Remember that a podcast is essentially a playlist, with multiple
         files.  Just an informal &ldquo;RFC.&rdquo;

      <div class="body">
         Big news... I removed the dependency on libid3tag, libvorbis, and
         libmp4v2. Now
         <a href="http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html">TagLib</a> is
         used for all meta-extraction. Much cleaner. Some bug fixes also. This
         does, however, bump the version &amp; format of the database, thus all
         vitunes databases will have to be re-built. It's much faster now
         though.

         While browsing the intertubes today, I noticed that
         <a href="http://ktown.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html">TagLib</a> was
         updated recently and now includes MP4/AAC metadata including
         iTunes-style metadata. This is awesome, as TagLib is both way cleaner,
         faster, and overall better than the libraries I'm currently using. I'm
         updating vitunes now to use this new library. When finished, vitunes
         will also be able to tag files.
