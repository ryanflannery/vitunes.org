   <dt>2012 January 2: Version 2.3 Released
      (<a href="changelogs/version-2.3.html">changelog</a>)
   </dt>
   <dd>
      First release in over a year, consisting entirely of work over 6 months old
      (much by others) that I never got around to pushing out.
      Multiple new features, performance improvements,
      and bugfixes.  Notable new features include toggle-lists, allowing one to
      quickly toggle through sets of commands, such as various sort or display schemas.
      One can now also control a running instance of vitunes remoltely, using the new
      '<tt>-c <i>command</i></tt>' option, allowing vitunes to be controlled remotely.
      <br />
      See complete changelog <a href="changelogs/version-2.3.html">here</a>, and the
      <a href="vitunes.html">man page</a> for usage.

   <dt>2011 July 11: Back</dt>
   <dd>
      New job, new city, and now finally the site is back up!  Once I'm finished
      moving, I hope to push out some new work.
   </dd>

   <dt>2011 March 15: Brief Hiatus</dt>
   <dd>
      With end-of-quarter grading, research, job-hunting, and dealing with my
      University closing my department (Computer Science.... !?!?!?), I'll be
      rather busy for the next few weeks and unable to contribute to the project.
      <br /><br />
      Keep an eye on the
      &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/ryanflannery/vitunes/network">Network</a>&rdquo;
      tab in the GitHub repo for some of the other contributor's work until I return.

   <dt>2011 February 16: ArchLinux Port Updated!</dt>
   <dd>
      With many thanks, Peter Polacik has updated the ArchLinux port of vitunes!
   </dd>

   <dt>2011 February 10: : Linux Support Now Working!</dt>
   <dd>
      With much thanks to Daniel Walter and Peter Polacik, vitunes now compiles and
      runs on Linux!  It requires a newer version of mplayer on Debian, and has some
      compile warnings (working on that), but it works!
      <br /><br />
      Mplayer version 1.0rc3 or later will do.  Alternatively, any version built with
      a checkout of the source <i>after</i> December 27, 2009 should do.
   </dd>

   <dt>2011 January 9: Version 2.2 Released</dt>
   <dd>
      This release adds no new functional features from version 2.1.  It does include
      a much better man-page and a build that works on Mac OS X.  That's it.
   </dd>

   <dt>2011 January 7: Mac OS X Support Added -- Needs Testing</dt>
   <dd>
      In the past few days I have added support for a clean build on Mac OS X.  That is,
      vitunes should build cleanly, as-is, on a Mac.  Only the following needs addressing
      by any Mac users:
      <ul>
         <li>Update the install locations in the Makefile (<tt>PREFIX</tt>)
            appropriately.</li>
         <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
            Edit the <tt>LDFLAGS</tt> variable in the Makefile to include
            <tt>-lncursesw</tt> rather than <tt>-lncurses</tt>.
            <br />
            </span>
            This is no longer required.
         </li>
         <li>Either manually modify the <tt>DEFAULT_PLAYER_PATH</tt> variable in
            <tt>config.h</tt>, <i>or</i> simply run vitunes with the <tt>-m</tt>
            flag and a proper path to <tt>mplayer</tt>.</li>
      </ul>
      With this, it should be rather trivial for a porter to get this into either
      <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a> or similar.
      <br /><br />
      Thanks to Joshua Conner and Andr&eacute; Berger for their help.
      <br /><br />
      <b>NOTE:</b> This isn't in any release yet, including the most recent, as it still
      needs heavy testing.  Use the repositories directly.
   </dd>

   <dt>2011 January 5: Version 2.1 Released: Small Bugfix Release</dt>
   <dd>
      There were some rather nasty formatting errors with the man page that shipped with
      the 2.0 release a few days ago.  They didn't show up during testing (e.g. with
      &ldquo;<tt>mandoc vitunes.1 | less</tt>&rdquo;), but did after installation (with
      &ldquo;<tt>man vitunes</tt>&rdquo;).
      <br /><br />
      This corrects those formatting problems (with a few other small patches as well).
   </dd>

   <dt>2011 January 1: Version 2.0 Released</dt>
   <dd>
      Version 2.0 is officially released.  Many new features, including support for custom
      keybindings (via the bind and unbind commands), undo/redo support, vastly improved
      synchronization between vitunes and mplayer, new display elements that are colorable,
      and new keybindings.
      <br /><br />

      <br /><br />
      This brings vitunes almost to a completion, at least in terms of what I always wanted
      it to be.  I'll be maintaining it indefinitely since I use it heavily, but I don't
      really foresee any major new features.  If you have ideas, let me know.
      <br /><br />
      Happy 2011!
   </dd>

   <dt>2010 December 29: Massive Re-Write Underway</dt>
   <dd>
      So my &ldquo;minor clean-up and a few feature additions&rdquo; has turned into a hackathon on my part.
      It rocks.  Far better synchronization with <tt>mplayer</tt> (less skipping), undo/redo, <tt>:map</tt>,
      more color-able stuff, support for the comment-field of media files, and cleaner syntax for all commands
      are all in the works.
      <br /><br />
      Unfortunately, these updates will either break compatability with previous versions of vitunes or require
      super-extra-massive effort on my part to make it backwards compatable by adding loads of goey goey c.
      Pondering...
      <br /><br />
      For the daring sort, you can use one of the repositories listed above to get a copy of the current
      development version and build yer own.  And hey, if you just feel like contributing something back,
      that'd be sweet.
   </dd>

   <dt>17 December 2010: Mailing List Up and New Stuff in the Works</dt>
   <dd>
      There is now a vitunes mailing list, hosted by <a href="http://www.freelists.org">freelists.org</a>.
      You can subscribe to the mailing list by visiting 
      <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/vitunes">this webpage</a>, and searchable archives are available
      <a href="http://www.freelists.org/archive/vitunes">here</a>.
      <br /><br />
      Now that school is out for the holiday break, I'm on a research binge during the day and a hacking binge
      during the night.  New features in the works...
   </dd>

   <dt>2010 April 27: 1.0.5 Released (Documentation Cleanup)</dt>
   <dd>
      New release, 1.0.5 made today.  A simple documentation cleanup.  The man page and
      output of all &ldquo;<tt>vitunes -e help COMMAND</tt>&rdquo; have been made more
      complete.  The man page is now the sole source of documentation (although the
      complete list of keybindings will remain here on the website, maintained).
   </dd>

   <dt>2010 February 17: Podcast Support?</dt>
   <dd>
      I'm contemplating adding podcast support.  I don't wish to have vitunes automatically
      download any files within a podcast (a simple shell script, or any number of other
      existing utilities could be used for that).  Rather, i'd like vitunes to just parse an
      RSS feed, extract info to view in vitunes, and pass the filenames to mplayer
      (mplayer handles URL's quite nicely).
      <br /><br />
      If anyone actually reads this.. any good ideas on how to integrate this into the vitunes ui?
      Remember that a podcast is essentially a playlist, with multiple files.  Just an informal
      &ldquo;RFC.&rdquo;
   </dd>

   <dt>2010 January 28: FreeBSD Port!?</dt>
   <dd>
      Catching up on <a href="http://www.freshports.org/">freshports</a> yesterday, I
      noticed that vitunes has been ported (for some time now!) to
      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> by Dennis Herrmann.  Many thanks
      to him!
   </dd>

   <dt>2010 January 20: 1.0.4 Released (Last one for a while)
      (<a href="changelogs/2010-01-20.html">changelog</a>)
   </dt>
   <dd>
      Last release for a while, baring any bug fixes.  A few bugs fixed, documentation
      updated, and I finally re-wrote the player code (only stuff untouched from
      previous rewrite).  Can now search in the library window.  Command abbreviations
      supported. Can right-align columns in display.
      See complete changelog <a href="changelogs/2010-01-20.html">here</a>.
   </dd>

   <dt>2010 January 14: 1.0.3 Released
      (<a href="changelogs/2010-01-13.html">changelog</a>)
   </dt>
   <dd>
      Big news... I removed the dependency on libid3tag, libvorbis, and libmp4v2.  Now
      <a href="http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html">TagLib</a> is used for
      all meta-extraction.  Much cleaner.  Some bug fixes also.  This does, however,
      bump the version &amp; format of the database, thus all vitunes databases will
      have to be re-built.  It's much faster now though.
      See the full changelog <a href="changelogs/2010-01-13.html">here</a>.
   </dd>

   <dt>2010 January 12: Upcoming Release</dt>
   <dd>
      While browsing the intertubes today, I noticed that
      <a href="http://ktown.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html">TagLib</a> was updated recently
      and now includes MP4/AAC metadata including iTunes-style metadata.  This is awesome,
      as TagLib is both way cleaner, faster, and overall better than the libraries I'm
      currently using.  I'm updating vitunes now to use this new library.  When finished,
      vitunes will also be able to tag files.

   <dt>2010 January 3: 1.0.1 Released</dt>
   <dd>A simple bug-fix release, fixing an issue where &ldquo;reload db&rdquo;
      would sometimes segfault due to a use-after-free.
