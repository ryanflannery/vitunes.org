<h2>Description</h2>
<tt>vitunes</tt> is a curses-based <i>playlist manager</i> and media player
for *nix operating systems with <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>-like
keybinds.  It's primary goal is to serve as an index of "tagged" multimedia
files and provide a quick, easy interface for browsing &amp; searching your
files, and creating playlists.
<br /><br />
It is similar in function to a certain graphical program used by
many on other operating systems.  <tt>vitunes</tt> works by extracting the
meta-information from media files and storing them in a central database,
forming a "Library" from which you can play your music and build playlists.
<tt>vitunes</tt> uses <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">mplayer</a> as a
back-end for actually playing all media.
<br /><br />
<b>NOTE:</b> <tt>vitunes</tt> is still under heavy development.  None-the-less,
it's reached a point where it's usable for others who may care to try it.
<br /><br />
<b>NOTE:</b> <tt>vitunes</tt> is developed on
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> and only OpenBSD.  As such, there
are (probably) many OpenBSD-isms in the code that would prevent it from
building and/or running on other *nix-like OS's.  <b>Cope.</b>

<h2>Features</h2>
<tt>vitunes</tt>...
<ul>
   <li>never moves / modifies your media files in any way</li>
   <li>never creates / modifies / deletes any files outside of
      <tt>~/.vitunes</tt></li>
   <li>uses <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">mplayer</a> to play media,
      so it can play anything <tt>mplayer</tt> can</li>
   <li>allows creating / managing playlists in a fast, <tt>vi</tt>-like
      fashion</li>
   <li>allows searching your library and playlists based on meta-information
      from the media files in the database</li>
</ul>
<tt>vitunes</tt> can extract meta-information from the following files:
<ul>
   <li>ID3v1 (and variants), ID3v2.x
      <br />
      (via <a href="http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/">libid3tag</a>)</li>
   <li>OGG/Vorbis comments
      <br />
      (via <a href="http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/">libvorbis</a>)</li>
   <li>MP4/AAC comments
      <br />
      (via <a href="http://resare.com/libmp4v2/">libmp4v2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<tt>vitunes</tt> is <b>NOT</b>...
<ul>
   <li>a media meta-information editor (you can't edit ID3 tags, vorbis
      comments, etc., from within <tt>vitunes</tt>).  Use other tools
      for that.</li>
   <li>a media-file organizer.  it leaves your files wherever you have
      them, untouched.  It requires only read access to the files to
      extract meta-information and play the file through mplayer.</li>
   <li>a full-featured, fancy-shmancy media <i>player</i>.  It's a playlist
      organizer at best, that can play music.</li>

<a name="overview"></a>
<h3>1. Quick Overview <b>&larr; READ THIS FIRST!</b></h3>
<p>
   <tt>vitunes</tt> works by first building a meta-information database, which
   is a database containing all media files and their meta information
   (artist, album, title, track number, year, genre, and playtime).  This
   database forms the "LIBRARY" which is all of the media files
   <tt>vitunes</tt> is capable of playing and working with.
   <ul>
      <li>&there4; IF a media file is <b>NOT</b> in the library,
         THEN that file will <b>NOT</b> appear within <tt>vitunes</tt>!
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
   This database is built using "<tt>vitunes -e createdb ...</tt>", and as
   you add/remove/modify any of your media files, you can update the
   database using "<tt>vitunes -e updatedb ...</tt>".  See
   <a href="#buildlibrary">&sect; 3. Building &amp; Updating the Library</a>
   for details.
</p>
<p>
   After the library has been created, <tt>vitunes</tt> can be run normally
   (simply "<tt>vitunes</tt>"), and you can browse your library, search it,
   create &amp; manage playlists, etc.
</p>
<p>
   The database <tt>vitunes</tt> builds and uses is stored in the file
   <tt>~/.vitunes/vitunes.db</tt>.  Additionally, the playlists it
   creates/manages are all stored in the directory
   <tt>~/.vitunes/playlists/</tt>.  These are created when the library
   database is first created.
</p>
<p>
   <b>NOTE:</b> It's important to remember that when you build/update your
   library, only files with meta information (ID3v* tags, vorbis comments,
   or MP4/AAC comments) are recorded.  Any other media files are simply
   ignored.
   <ul>
      <li>&there4; IF you want a media file (song/video) in the library,
         THEN that file <b>must</b> have some meta information.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<a name="buildinstall"></a>
<h3>2. Building &amp; Installing</h3>
<p>
   <tt>vitunes</tt> requires the following libraries to be installed to build:
   <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/">libid3tag</a>
         (OpenBSD package name: <tt>libid3tag</tt>)
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/">libvorbis</a>
         (OpenBSD package name: <tt>libvorbis</tt>)
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://resare.com/libmp4v2/">libmp4v2</a>
         (OpenBSD package name: <tt>libmp4v2</tt>)
      </li>
   </ul>
   Additionally, to have vitunes actually play music,
   <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">mplayer</a> must be installed
   (OpenBSD package name: <tt>mplayer</tt>).
</p>
<p>
   After these are installed, a simple
   <pre>
      # make
      # make install
   </pre>
   <i>should</i> build and install <tt>vitunes</tt>.
</p>

<a name="buildlibrary"></a>
<h3>3. Building &amp; Updating the Library</h3>
<p>
   Before <tt>vitunes</tt> will run, you must build the meta-information
   database containing all of the meta-information of the media files you want
   to be able to play in <tt>vitunes</tt>.  To do this, do the following:
   <pre>
      # vitunes -e createdb /path/to/music1 [ /path/to/music2 ... ]
   </pre>
   This will recursively search all the paths provided and for each file
   encountered, <tt>vitunes</tt> will attempt to extract any meta-information.
   If such information is found, the file's information is added to the database
   <tt>~/.vitunes/vitunes.db</tt>.
</p>
<p>
   Additionally, whenever you add/remove/update your media files, you can run
   <pre>
      # vitunes -e updatedb [ /path/to/moremusic1 ... ]
   </pre>
   to have <tt>vitunes</tt> update its database (re-scan all files currently
   in the database to see if the meta information has changed and remove any
   entries for files that have been removed), and even add new directories
   (searched recursively) to the library.
</p>
<p>
   <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> <i>only</i> files for which some meta information is
   found are added to the library.  All others are skipped.
   <br />
   You can parse the output of the <tt>createdb</tt> and <tt>updatedb</tt>
   commands easily to see which files were added or not.
</p>
<p>
   For a list of all e-commands <tt>vitunes</tt> has, run
   <pre>
      # vitunes -e help
   </pre>
   For more information on a specific e-command and its usage, run
   <pre>
      # vitunes -e help command
   </pre>
</p>

<a name="running"></a>
<h3>4. Running <tt>vitunes</tt> Normally</h3>
<p>
   Once you have created the database above, you can run <tt>vitunes</tt>
   normally by simply
   <pre>
      # vitunes
   </pre>
   This will launch a curses-based interface similar to what you see in the
   screenshot on this page.
</p>
<p>
   What follows next are descriptions of the user interface, the
   key-bindings, and commands available in "command-mode" for altering the
   state of <tt>vitunes</tt>.
</p>

<a name="ui"></a>
<h3>4.1. The User Interface</h3>
The user interface is divided into 4 sections, which are in different colors
in the screenshot below:
<center><img src="screenshots/old-tiny.png" /></center>
<ol>
   <li><b>Play Window</b> The top row (colored
      <span style="color: #ffff00; background-color: black;">yellow</span>
      above)
      <br />
      This window provides information on the currently playing file, if any.
      If no file is currently playing, the window is empty except for a
      shameless shout-out to <tt>vitunes</tt> in the right.<br />
      If a file is playing, then the following information is displayed:
      <ol>
         <li>A <b>play-mode character</b>, which is one of:
            <ul>
               <li>"<b><tt>-</tt></b>" for linear mode (files in the playlist
                  are played in-order until the end of the playlist is
                  reached).
               </li>
               <li>"<b><tt>O</tt></b>" for loop (like linear, only once the
                  end of the playlist is reached, playing resumes with the
                  first file in the playlist).
               </li>
               <li>"<b><tt>?</tt></b>" for random (where files from the
                  playlist are chosen at random to be played).
               </li>
            </ul>
            The default is loop.
         </li>
         <li>A <b>pause-indicator</b>, which is the string
            "<b><tt>[PAUSED]</tt></b>" if playback is currently paused, and
            empty otherwise.
         </li>
         <li>The <b>time into the current file</b> which is in the format
            "<b><tt>hh:mm:ss</tt></b>".
         </li>
         <li>The <b>position into the current file as a percent</b>, if
            the total playlength of the file is available, -1 otherwise.
         </li>
         <li>The <b>Title</b> of the current file if available, otherwise
            as much of the filename as will fit in the window.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <br /><br />
   </li>
   <li><b>Command Window</b> The bottom row (colored
      <span style="color: #00ffff; background-color: black;">cyan</span>
      above)
      <br />
      This window serves two purposes.
      <br />
      When <i>not</i> in command mode it provides the following information
      about the <tt>vitunes</tt> interface.
      <ol>
         <li>The <b>currently focused window</b> (one of either
            "<b><tt>[playlist]</tt></b>" or "<b><tt>[medialist]</tt></b>" is
            displayed.
         </li>
         <li>The <b>vertical and horizontal offsets</b> are displayed as
            the pair "<b><tt>i,j</tt></b>" where <b><tt>i</tt></b> is the
            line number of the currently selected row in either the playlist
            or medialist window (whichever has focus), and <b><tt>j</tt></b>
            is the amount of horizontal scrolling used (again, for either the
            playlist or medialist window, whichever has focus).
         </li>
         <li>The <b>vertical percent</b> into the current buffer (playlist or
            medialist window), which is basically the current row number
            divided by the total number of rows times 100.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      When in command mode, the command window is cleared and commands may
      be entered to alter <tt>vitunes</tt> (e.g. the command
      "<b><tt>:q</tt></b>" is used to exist <tt>vitunes</tt>).
      <br /><br />
   </li>
   <li><b>Playlist Window</b> The left-window (colored
      <span style="color: #ff00ff; background-color: black;">magenta</span>
      above)
      <br />
      This window always shows a list of all playlists available, loaded
      from the <tt>~/.vitunes/playlists/</tt> directory when <tt>vitunes</tt>
      starts.
      <br /><br />
      The first two entries are always shown and are <i>pseudo-playlists</i>.
      They are:
      <ol>
         <li>"<b><tt>--LIBRARY--</tt></b>" which is the database of all songs
            in the vitunes meta-information database.
         </li>
         <li>"<b><tt>&lt;search results&gt;</tt></b>" which is a playlist
            built/destroyed every time a search of any playlist is performed.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <br /><br />
   </li>
   <li><b>Medialist Window</b> The right-window row (colored
      <span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: black;">white</span>
      above)
      <br />
      This window always shows the contents of whatever playlist was
      selected for viewing.  The information shown for each file is all of
      the meta-information available.  If no information is available, the
      filename is shown instead.
      <br /><br />
   </li>
</ol>

<a name="keybindings"></a>
<h3>4.2. Key Bindings</h3>
The following key-bindings are used to interact with <tt>vitunes</tt>.
They should be familiar to any vi/vim users.
<dl>
   <dt>TAB</dt>
   <dd>Switch focus between the playlist/medialist windows</dd>

   <dt>j / k</dt>
   <dd>Move current row (highlighted) down/up one row (works in both playlist
      and medialist windows)</dd>

   <dt>h / l</dt>
   <dd>Horizontal scroll left / right one character (works in both playlist
      and medialist windows)</dd>

   <dt>CTRL-u / CTRL-d</dt>
   <dd>Scroll up / down 1/2 page (works in both playlist and medialist
      windows)</dd>

   <dt>ENTER</dt>
   <dd>If focus is in the playlist window, this loads the currently selected
      playlist in the medialist window.
      If focus is in the medialist window, this plays the current file.</dd>

   <dt>z</dt>
   <dd>Pause/un-pause current playback (works in either playlist or medialist
      windows).</dd>

   <dt>s</dt>
   <dd>Stop current playback (works in either playlist or medialist
      windows).</dd>

   <dt>f / b</dt>
   <dd>Skip forward / backward 10 seconds in playing of current file (works
      in either playlist or medialist windows).</dd>

   <dt>yy</dt>
   <dd>If focus is in medialist window, copies ("yanks") current file to
      copy-buffer.  If focus is in playlist window, does nothing.<br />
      Use of "<tt>y<i>X</i></tt>" will work as in <tt>vim</tt> (i.e. it will
      copy the next <i>X</i> lines).
      </dd>

   <dt>dd</dt>
   <dd>Delete current playlist (if focus is in playlist window) or current
      file (if focus is in medialist window).<br />
      Use of "<tt>d<i>X</i></tt>" will work as in <tt>vim</tt> (i.e. it will
      delete the next <i>X</i> lines).
      </dd>

   <dt>p / P</dt>
   <dd>Paste any file(s) in the copy-buffer before / after the current
      row in the current playlist.  Only works when focus is on medialist
      window.</dd>

   <dt>CTRL+l</dt>
   <dd>Clear and re-draw the entire screen.</dd>

   <dt>"/"</dt>
   <dd>Start searching the currently viewing playlist.  The query entered
      is first tokenized, and all entries in the current playlist that match
      <i>all</i> tokens (case-insensitive) are displayed.  These search
      results form the pseudo-playlist "&lt;search results&gt;", which can
      be saved as a regular playlist using "<b><tt>:w name</tt></b>".
   </dd>

   <dt>":"</dt>
   <dd>Enter command-mode (see below for commands).</dd>
</dl>

<a name="commandmode"></a>
<h3>4.3. Command Mode</h3>
Similar to command mode in vi/vim, <tt>vitunes</tt> command mode allows you
to execute various commands.  This is a list of all such commands.
<dl>
   <dt>:q</dt>
   <dd>Exit <tt>vitunes</tt></dd>

   <dt>:w[!] [name]</dt>
   <dd>Use "<b><tt>:w</tt></b>" to save the current playlist being viewed in
      the medialist window.  Use "<b><tt>:w name</tt></b>" to save the
      playlist as "name" instead.  If a playlist with the given name already
      exists, use "<b><tt>:w! name</tt></b>" to force.<br />
      NOTE: You cannot save the "--LIBRARY--" or "&lt;search-results&gt;"
      pseudo-playlists, since they do not actually exist as playlists.
      You can save them as a new playlist, however, using
      "<b><tt>:w name</tt></b>".
   </dd>

   <dt>:new playlist</dt>
   <dd>Create a new, empty playlist</dd>

   <dt>:mode [ linear | loop | random ]</dt>
   <dd>Set the current playmode to one of linear (all files in the playlist
      are played in the order they appear, until the end of the playlist is
      reached), loop (like linear, but playing of the playlist loops
      indefinitely), or random (where files from the playlist are played in
      a random order).
</dl>

<a name="faq"></a>
<h3>Appendix A. F. A. Q.</h3>
<dl>
   <dt>What license is <tt>vitunes</tt> distributed under?</dt>
   <dd>That's a good question, and I'm still trying to figure it out.
      The <tt>libmp4v2</tt> dependency has some rather strict licensing.
      I'm still investigating what license <tt>vitunes</tt> needs to be
      under.
   </dd>
</dl>

<i>more is forthcoming</i>

<a name="todo"></a>
<h3>Appendix B. TODO.</h3>
Before the "1.0" release, the following will be finished...
<ul>
   <li><i>much</i> more testing to flush out the bugs that no-doubt inhabit
      <tt>vitunes</tt>.
   </li>
   <li>ADD: runtime ability &amp; command line switch to set/change playlist
      width
   </li>
   <li><del>ADD: support for resizing display!</del>
      <i>It now works beautifully with
      <a href="http://www.peereboom.us/scrotwm/html/scrotwm.html">scrotwm(1)</a>!</i>
   </li>
   <li>ADD: ability to sort files in medialist by user specified order</li>
   <li>ADD: ability to change listing format for media</li>
   <li>ADD: ability to change colors</li>
   <li>ADD: a config file!  wooooo!</li>
   <li>FIX: get genre's from mp4/aac audio files.
      (I think this is a bug in the mp4 library, where it sometimes returns a
      pointer to static memory rather than malloc(3)'d memory... I think when
      it's an ID3v1-style genre).
   </li>
   <li>FIX: get playtime from mpeg (including mp3) files.</li>
   <li><del>FIX: createdb function works, but updatedb is currently
      un-implemented.</del>
   </li>
   <li><del>FIX: backspace/delete/left stuff when user inputs a string</del></li>
   <li>FIX: redraws are currently very expensive... anytime anything changes
      in a window, the entire thing is re-drawn.
   </li>
   <li>FIX: remove all (or most) statically-sized arrays.
      <br />
      <b>UPDATE:</b> Only playlists are now statically sized (to 1,000 songs).
   </li>
